To Do: 
1: Change or Remove FEV, I think we can do better for the Super Mutants. Maybe bothering to read the fallout wiki could help
2: REMOVE THE ANTS WHY IS THAT SO FUCKING BROKEN or you know, just give the character a single ant rather than going to the route of spawning ant queens day 1. The acid queen and the red queen is quite strong, maybe keep fungicidal ant queen???
3: Balance the guns, already took out the BBs, cant do anything else
4: Maybe figuring out which creatures get removed? Glowing deathclaws are not fun at all. Also probably adjusting spawns (if I am smart enough) and adjusting meat drops.
5: P r a y you understand the martial arts
6: Try the food then crafting
7: Poke around randomly to find other issues
